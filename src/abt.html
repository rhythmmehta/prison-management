<h3>Prisons serve the public by keeping in safe custody those committed
by the courts and treating them with humanity and helping them to
lead a useful life in society as a law abiding citizen  after their
release from the Prison. The theory of Reformation and Rehabilitation
is followed in the Prisons of this country.
The Director General of Prisons who is the Head of Department is an 
I.P.S. Officer in the rank of Director General of Police. He is assisted 
by one Deputy Inspector General of Prisons at Headquarters and 4 Deputy 
Inspector General of Prisons at the Range and one Chief Probation Superintendent
 in the Probation Branch. There are 10 Superintendents and two lady Superintendent
for two women Prisons. Each Central Prison exercises control over Sub Jails situated
in Districts under its jurisdiction. The Sub Jail is administered by an Assistant Jailor
who is designated as Superintendent of Sub Jail.

The Administration of prisons is accorded utmost priority by Government.
Concerted efforts are taken to improve the all round welfare measures of
prisoners and basic infrastructure facilities. While strengthening the safety
and security of Prisons, administrative changes are being made in Prisons. 


<b><h2>HISTORY</h2></b>
In India, the early prisons were only places of detention
where an offender was detained until trial and judgment
and the execution of the latter. The structure of the society
in ancient India was founded on the principles enunciated
by Manu and explained by Yagnavalkya, Kautilya and others.7
Among various types of corporal punishments – branding,
hanging, mutilation and death, the imprisonment was
the most mild kind of penalty known prominently in ancient
Indian penology. Imprisonment occupied an ordinary place
among the penal treatment and this type of corporal punishment
was suggested in Hindu scriptures, the evildoer was
put into prison to segregate him from the society. The main
aim of imprisonment was to keep awaythe wrong doers, so
that theymight not defile the members of social order.


<b><h2>PRESENT</h2></b>
Prisons in India, and their administration, is a state subject covered by item
4 under the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. 
The management and administration of prisons falls exclusively in the domain 
of the State governments, and is governed by the Prisons Act, 1894 and the 
Prison manuals of the respective state governments. Thus, states have the 
primary role, responsibility and authority to change the current prison laws,
rules and regulations.[1] The Central Government provides assistance to the 
states to improve security in prisons, for the repair and renovation of old prisons,
 medical facilities, development of borstal schools, facilities to women offenders,
vocational training, modernization of prison industries, training to prison personnel,
and for the creation of high security enclosures.
